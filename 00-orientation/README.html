## The Big Picture

--

* You're embarking on an adventure. You'll experience highs and lows.

--

* You're here to _be_ a programmer. Start now. Writing code is your job.

--

* Focus on process and problem solving over details.
  * Trying to memorize everything _will not_ give the best outcome!
  * Writing correct code is about being able to debug, not remember.
  * Tests on learn are like bumper lanes in a bowling alley.
  * So learn to run your code "by hand".

---

## A few things to know about Flatiron

--

### Timelines

* You're with us for 15 weeks, broken into 5 3-week mods.
  * One each on: Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React. Then final projects!
* Each mod has 2 weeks of class and an exam, followed by a project week.
  * During project week, you will be building an app of your design all day.

--

### The Purpose of Lecture

* Bringing a pen, paper, and whiteboard is as useful as a laptop. Don't type along.

--

* Lectures are recorded and code is uploaded. They are accessible immediately after lunch.

--

* See the concepts beforehand so lecture time can focus on questions and nuances.

---

### The Purpose of Labs

Quoth Tez, "Don't pay attention to the damn green lights!"

--

Lab completion feels like getting all the collectibles in a game or something.
But a green light doesn't mean you _understand_ what you've been doing.

--

Sooner or later, we'll release more labs than you can finish in a day.
I'm aware of no student that has done every lab, nor do I think doing every lab is the best goal.

--

A recommended lab process is:

* Do all the READMEs (and maybe a code along) in a section, then attempt the last lab.
  * If you're able to do it without a ton of issues, move on.
  * If you find yourself getting stuck a lot, go back and do some of the earlier labs in the section 
    on specific topics you're struggling with.

## What it takes to succeed

--

### Key points

1. Fail with confidence. 💪
2. There is no finish line. ✨
3. Be open with us and each other. ❤️

---

### What it takes to succeed

#### Failing

--

* [Listen to Julia][julia] Evans.

[julia]: https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/726201450079113216

--

* You're going to hit walls. A lot.
  * (If you don't, this isn't the best use of your time.)

--

* You will spend more of your career reading and debugging code than writing it!
  * So see those things as important. Don't be discouraged by errors.
  * When writing code, we're experimenting constantly. Run the code, not just the tests.

---

### What it takes to succeed

#### Curiosity

--

> Is studying computer science the best way to prepare to be a programmer?

> No. The best way to prepare is to write programs and
> study programs others have written. ... You've got to want to be
> in this incredible feedback loop where you get people to tell you
> what you're doing wrong.

* Bill Gates, Programmers at Work

--

Your goal _isn't_ the completion of this course. You won't get jobs because of a certificate.

--

Focus on your programming process, not "finishing" all the content.

Pay attention to phases of learning:
  * Reading code written by a professional. (easiest)
  * Being able to write working code while referencing examples. (next day)
  * Being able to write code without examples, just looking up occasional syntax. (next week)

---

### What it takes to succeed

#### Vulnerability

--

* Impostor syndrome is real. Know that I believe you _can_ be a programmer.
  * And there were plenty of times I wondered if I would "make it".

--

* Ask me to explain things til I'm hoarse. Until _you_ are satisfied.

--

* Be careful about evaluating your progress _while in motion_.
  * It's natural to want to compare yourself to others. Instead, focus on what's in front of you.

--

* We move _fast_. You are _supposed to struggle_. The usual pattern is:
  * Find a concept difficult to understand and use the day it's introduced.
  * Be able to reproduce it the following day, referring to documentation or examples.
  * Comfortable using it with minimal googling or references in 4-5 days.

--

* Use staff, slack, and, by all means, each other.
  * But root out misunderstandings, don't reveal answers.

---

## Some Expectations

--

* Get a full night's sleep. Get here on time.
* Be responsible adults. Pursue this seriously.
* Be respectful of each other's experiences.
* Enjoy programming with us. :)
