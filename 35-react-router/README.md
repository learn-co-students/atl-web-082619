# My Mod 5 Journal Project
Use your newfound knowledge of React Router to create a Mod 5 Journal that you can use to share your development process. 

Using this boilerplate, work on deliverables that will strengthen your knowledge of the React router library. Work to refactor the existing code (which is not DRY) and make this app dynamic and visible to the public (and your potential employers!)

## Deliverables

- Fork and use this boilerplate to start your journal app 

- create a data file that is seeded relatively or from an API that creates 5 blog posts 

- add information on the Home page that shares: 
-- your project specs
-- your future aspirations as an engineer 

- add information on the About page that shares: 
-- a blurb about you and why you've chosen engineering as your intended career path
-- links to your social media pages 

- edit the CSS to fit your style

- publish your journal to make it accessible using Netlify or Heroku

### Stretch Goal

- Add a new route that separates out your project specs, with links to other routes within your app
